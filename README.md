# ccxt-rs

A Rust library for cryptocurrency trading and e-commerce with support for many bitcoin/ether/altcoin
exchange markets and merchant APIs.

Totally inspired by the [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) library and intended to be a native and 
idiomatic implementation for Rust-based systems.

Currently it is at a very early stage of development.
